                    <span class="about-1">
                        <p>As parents, we hear over and over again the benefits of reading to babies or toddlers. If you
                            think about it, as an adult, reading is a major part of our everyday lives.
                            Introducing your baby or toddler to reading early helps with language skills and cognitive
                            development.</p>

                    <span class="about-2">
                        <p>Sure you may be reading a story to your child. Or they may be listening to one of their toys
                            read
                            to them. But while listening
                            and comprehending the story, their brain will paint a picture of that story in their head.
                            Their
                            imagination is kicked into gear and they develop
                            cognitive images for how they interpret what is being read to them, or what they are
                            reading.
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are many ways that you can incorporate reading into your child’s daily routine.
                            Sometimes
                            we don’t always have time to sit and read a book.
                            Toy companies such as V-Tech or LeapFrog have come out with many educational, yet fun, toys
                            for
                            babies or toddlers.
                            Even young school-age children can benefit from toys or games that are centered around
                            reading.

            <span class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/gruffalo-book-cover.jpg"
                    alt="A touch and feel book about the gruffalo">
                <p>This one is top of my list. Because it's a touch book, it's more interactive which is great. My
                    kid's
                    even kiss the gruffalo's fur at the end of the book while he is asleep.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/kipper-book-cover.webp"
                    alt="A collective story book about a dog named kipper with pictures at the side indicating story topics">
                <p>I alway's loved kipper book's and because it has simple white background on every page, it's easier
                    for
                    kid's to focus on what's important. For example, a page will have just kipper the dog holding a bowl
                    of cake mix.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/llama-llama-book-cover.jpg"
                    alt="a llama wearing red pajama's in a bed, holding a teddy bear">
                <p>A brilliant example for rhyme and pace. As the baby gets more worried, you start reading the rhyme's
                    faster which work's really well at keeping a child's attention until momma runs upstairs. It's good
                    fun to read, really emotive.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/hungry-caterpillar-book-cover.jpg"
                    alt="A simple, green and red, fat caterpilar">
                <p>This book is very colorful and visually pleasing. It also has repetition for every day of the week
                    making it easy for children to follow. Having pages that are smaller than the rest is fun too.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/seasons-come-go-book-cover.jpg"
                    alt="A colorful tree at night with a hole cut out the center of all pages with an owl at the end of the book peeping through the hole">
                <p>The rhyming in this book is very smooth and flow's well. Pair that with the feature of cut out shapes
                    with each page and replace them with pictures of other animals, then you have a fun, unique book</p>
