                    <p>To start, I love reading books with my kid's. It's a simple, relaxing activity that brings us closer and make's us more intimate.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are many, many benefits from kid's reading early or even just listening to their parent's read to them.
                        Book's are very good at catching and holding young children's attention because of the rhyme and repetition.

                        enthusiastic attitude will help them look at it in a positive way. Their level of comprehensions is also depends on if 
                         if they are paying attention - there listening skills, so its good practice in helping them take in to deatails too.</p>
