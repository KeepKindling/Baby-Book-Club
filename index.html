                <div class="about-1">
                    <p>To start, I love reading books with my kid's. It's a simple, relaxing activity that
                        brings us closer
                        and make's us more intimate.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="about-2">
                    <p>There are many, many benefits from kid's reading early or even just listening to their parent's
                        read
                        to them.
                        Book's are very good at catching and holding young children's attention because of the rhyme and
                        repetition.
                        Reading help's them to learn emotion, be expressive and promote's brain development and
                        imagination.
                        I think
                        people are unaware of the level of nurturing and reassurance it provide's because babies loving
                        hearing familiar voice's.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>A lot of kid's grow up frowning upon literacy, labelling it a boring subject but reading to them
                        when
                        they are very young and with an
                        enthusiastic attitude will help them look at it in a positive way. Their level of comprehensions
                        is
                        also depends on if
                        if they are paying attention - there listening skills, so its good practice in helping them take
                        in
                        to deatails too.</p>

        <h2>My Favorite Book's to Read</h2>

        <div>
            <div>
                <div class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/gruffalo-book-cover.jpg"
                        alt="A touch and feel book about the gruffalo">
                    <p>This one is top of my list. Because it's a touch book, it's more interactive which is great. My
                        kid's
                        even kiss the gruffalo's fur at the end of the book while he is asleep.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/kipper-book-cover.webp"
                        alt="A collective story book about a dog named kipper with pictures at the side indicating story topics">
                <p>I alway's loved kipper book's and because it has simple white background on every page, it's easier for
                    kid's to focus on what's important. For example, a page will have just kipper the dog holding a bowl of cake mix.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="photo-container"><img class="photo" src="/assets/css/images/llama-llama-book-cover.jpg"
                        alt="a llama wearing red pajama's in a bed, holding a teddy bear">
                <p>A brilliant example for rhyme and pace. As the baby gets more worried, you start reading the rhyme's
                    faster which work's really well at keeping a child's attention until momma runs upstairs. It's good
                    fun to read, really emotive.</p>

                        alt="A simple, green and red, fat caterpilar">
                <p>This book is very colorful and visually pleasing. It also has repetition for every day of the week
                    making it easy for children to follow. Having pages that are smaller than the rest is fun too.</p>

                        alt="A colorful tree at night with a hole cut out the center of all pages with an owl at the end of the book peeping through the hole">
                <p>The rhyming in this book is very smooth and flow's well. Pair that with the feature of cut out shapes
                    with each page and replace them with pictures of other animals, then you have a fun, unique book</p>
